I have a girlfriend who has rode a bycicle 9 times in her lifetime.
However, at the second day we arrive to the Netherlands, she suggests
she should get a scooter to perform a 2-hour commute.

The Netherlands is one of the safest countries in the world for riding a
bike, with only 3.8 road deaths per 100.000 inhabitants.

## Dedicated infrastructure

### Parking

Bicycle facilities that accomodate everyone.

The bike lane availability is incredible.

### Intermodal

You can take the bicycle anywhere. Hop on the metro. Hop on the train.
Especially around hubs, there is a safe place to leave your bicycle.
This leads to the next topic

### Continuous

Even over a bridge. Dedicated lanes for each way!

## Culture

Bike goes Before pedestrians even!
